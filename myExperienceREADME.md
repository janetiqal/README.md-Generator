# Homework 7
Creating a README.md Generator 
# README.md-Generator
The purpose of this assignment is to use Node.js and everything I have learned so far with JavaScript to create a README.md Generator.

## Description

To create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. This application will give users the option to not sacrifice coding hours in order to create a thorough README. The user is able to fill in fields titled: Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. The user is able to choose from an array of licenses to use for their project, and a license badge and the link to the description is linked in the section titled License. 

## My Experience 
This was a great excersize in learning about the back end and how powerful it can be. Seeing the prompts from the command line dynamically generate an md file was key in helping me understand the possibililies working with node.js and gave me a better understanding of the back end development.
