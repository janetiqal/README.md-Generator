HW7: Creating a good README.md Generator using Node.js and the Inquirer package. 

## Description

To create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. This application will give users the option to not sacrifice coding hours in order to create a thorough README. The user is able to fill in fields titled: Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. The user is able to choose from an array of licenses to use for their project, and a license badge and the link to the description is linked in the section titled License. 

## My Experience 
This was a good excersie in learning about the back end and how powerful it can be.
